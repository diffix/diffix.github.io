## Overview

**SynDiffix** is an open-source tool for generating statistically-accurate and strongly anonymous synthetic data from structured data. Compared to existing open-source and proprietary commercial approaches, SynDiffix is

- many times more accurate,
- has comparable or better ML efficacy,
- runs as fast or faster,
- has stronger anonymization.

## Purpose

Synthetic data has two primary use cases:

1. Descriptive analytics (histograms, heatmaps, column correlations, basic statistics like counting, averages, standard deviations, and so on)
2. Machine learning (building models)

While **SynDiffix** serves both use cases, it is especially good at descriptive analytics. The quality of descriptive analytics is many times that of other synthetic data products.

Obtaining this improvement, however, requires a different usage style compared to other products. The intended usage style of other products is "*one size fits all*": a single synthetic dataset serves all use cases. By contrast, with **SynDiffix**, a different *tailored* synthetic dataset should be produced for each use case.
